# Semantic searcher for images from the show *MyGO!!!*

A small tool to help MyGO fans communicate
- **Semantic search** is a search technique based on the matching the meaning of keywords instead of literal strings, which supports keywords with different wordings or in another language
    - Example: the image of Anon saying the line "是又怎樣？" can be found by querying "so what"

## Usage
- (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

- Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How does it work?
